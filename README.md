# Sorting-Visualization
This project is a comprehensive visualization tool for understanding and comparing different sorting algorithms. It provides an interactive platform to visualize the step-by-step process of various sorting techniques, making it an excellent educational resource for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning about sorting algorithms.
<br><br>
<b>Algorithms Implmented: </b><br>
1) Bubble Sort <br>
2) Selection Sort <br>
3) Insertion Sort <br>
4) Merge Sort <br>
5) Quick Sort <br>
6) Heap Sort <br>
<br><br>
<b>Features: </b><br>
1) <b>Colored representation of step being executed: <br></b>
	a) Blue : default <br>
	b) Yellow : Being compared <br>
	c) Red : Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved <br>
