# Sorting-Visualization
This project is a comprehensive visualization tool for understanding and comparing different sorting algorithms. It provides an interactive platform to visualize the step-by-step process of various sorting techniques, making it an excellent educational resource for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning about sorting algorithms.

<b>ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED: </b><br>
1) Bubble Sort <br>
2) Selection Sort <br>
3) Insertion Sort <br>
4) Merge Sort <br>
5) Quick Sort <br>
6) Heap Sort <br>

<b>FEATURES: </b><br>
1) <i><b>Colored representation of step being executed: <br></b></i>
	a) Blue: default <br>
	b) Yellow: Being compared <br>
	c) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved <br>
	d) Green: In correct position <br>
2) <i><b>3 Controls for visualizations</b><br></i>
	a) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)<br>
	b) Data size()<br>
	c) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).<br>
3) <i><b>Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.</b></i>
